# This notebook is structured as follows:
* Exploratory Data Analysis: In this section, we explore the dataset by taking a look at the
feature distributions, how correlated one feature is to the other and create some Seaborn
and Plotly visualisations
* Feature Engineering and Categorical Encoding: Conduct some feature engineering as well
as encode all our categorical features into dummy variables
* Implementing Machine Learning models: We implement a Random Forest and a Gradient
Boosted Model after which we look at feature importances from these respective models

Let's Go..
